It's wonderful when we're in a good headspace. üí¨ Happiness is like a muscle - the more we exercise it, the stronger it gets. Try to notice what specifically is making you feel good right now and hold onto that feeling. üòÑ You know what they say in psychology: "A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes!" üß† Keep spreading those good vibes!`,

      sad: `üå°Ô∏è I hear the heaviness in your words, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely valid. üí¨ Sadness is actually a healthy emotion that helps us process difficult experiences and connect with our deeper needs. It's okay to sit with these feelings for a while. üòÑ Here's something that might bring a small smile: Why did the therapist bring tissues to every session? Because they knew that tears are just the heart's way of speaking when words aren't enough! üß† Remember, this feeling is temporary, and you're stronger than you know.`,

      angry: `üå°Ô∏è I can sense the frustration and intensity in what you're sharing - anger often shows up when something important to us feels threatened. üí¨ Anger is actually a secondary emotion that usually covers hurt, fear, or disappointment. Take a few deep breaths and try to identify what's underneath that anger. üòÑ You know what's funny? Anger is like a smoke alarm - it's really loud and annoying, but it's just trying to tell you something needs attention! üß† Channel that energy into understanding what you really need right now.`,

      anxious: `üå°Ô∏è I can feel the worry and tension in your message, and I want you to know that anxiety is your mind's way of trying to protect you, even if it doesn't feel helpful right now. üí¨ Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. üòÑ Here's a gentle reminder: Anxiety is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do but doesn't get you anywhere! üß† You've handled 100% of your difficult days so far, and you'll handle this one too.`,

      lonely: `üå°Ô∏è I can feel the isolation in your words, and I want you to know that feeling lonely doesn't mean you're alone - it means you're human and wired for connection. üí¨ Loneliness is actually our emotional GPS telling us we need meaningful connection. Even this conversation right now is a form of connection! üòÑ You know what's beautiful? Even when we feel most alone, we're all under the same sky, breathing the same air, and sharing this human experience together! üß† Consider reaching out to one person today, even if it's just a simple "thinking of you" message.`

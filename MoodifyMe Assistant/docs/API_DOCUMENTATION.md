This helps anchor you in the present moment. üòÑ Here's something to lighten the mood: Why did the anxious person bring a ladder to the interview? Because they wanted to reach new heights of confidence! üß† Remember, you've prepared for this, and even if it doesn't go perfectly, each interview is valuable practice for building your skills.",
